A linear, or 1D, camera is a type of camera that sweeps a linear sensor array over the scene, rather than capturing the scene using a single impression on a 2D sensor array. They are often used in satellite imagery, industrial inspection, or hyperspectral imaging. In satellite imaging calibration is often done through a collection of ground points for which the 3D locations are known. In other applications, e.g. hyperspectral imaging, such known points are not available and annotating many different points is onerous. Hence we will use a checkerboard for calibration. The state-of-the-art method for linear camera calibration with a checkerboard becomes unstable when the checkerboards are parallel to the image plane. Our proposed method yields more accurate camera calibrations without suffering from this shortcoming.
