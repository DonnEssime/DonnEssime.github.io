In this phd thesis, we examine the entire 3D reconstruction chain, spending due time on both the calibration process (for various camera models), as well as the reconstruction step. We give an overview of the various 3D reconstruction techniques, and situate all the previous research within the 3D reconstruction framework.
I was awarded the title 'Doctor of Computer Science Engineering' at Ghent University after succesfully defending this work in front of an academic jury.
