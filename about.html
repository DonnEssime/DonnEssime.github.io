## About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Intelligent Systems Lab (Intel) lead by [Vladlen Koltun](http://vladlen.info/). 
Previously, I finished my Ph.D. at Graz University of Technology with a focus on deep learning for 2.5D and 3D. 
During this time, I also had the opportunity to intern at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and Amazon PrimeAir.
