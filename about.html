## About

I am a forth year Computer Science Ph.D. student and university assistant at Graz University of Technology under the supervision of [Horst Bischof](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/).
My research focuses on low-level computer vision, pose estimation and 3D computer vision with the common theme of applying novel machine learning techniques, e.g. deep learning, to tackle those problems.
Beside my research activities, I am responsible for two practical computer vision courses and a seminar on advanced pattern recognition.
