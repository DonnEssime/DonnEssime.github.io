## About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Autonomous Vision Group lead by [Andreas Geiger](http://cvlibs.net), part of the Intelligent Systems department of the Max-Planck Group.
Previously, I finished my PhD at Ghent University (Belgium), working on the entire imaging chain for 3D reconstruction.
During this time, I had the pleasure to intern at the Bell Labs (then Alcatel, now Nokia) in Antwerps, as well as with the Autonomous Vision Group I am now part of.
